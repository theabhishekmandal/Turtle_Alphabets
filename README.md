## Limitations

1 - The code works fine for all alphabets and numericals ,but not for special characters

2 - Also, the screen does not open in full screen mode till now, still working...

3 - if the string ends in one line in the turtle screen then the cursor won't go to next line

4 - if the speed of the cursor is increased then the slowness of the cursor is visible while drawing curves.
